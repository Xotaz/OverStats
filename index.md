Please always allow up to 1-12 hours for information to update.

If some information does not match your Overwatch profile or you are having issues with the bot, please join the [Support Discord](https://discord.gg/298) and provide as much info as possible for us to assist you. (This includes your Battletag and platform of play)

We do not save/record any of your private details. **Only your Battletag & Discord ID will be saved.**
